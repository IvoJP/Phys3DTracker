Instructions for Running Our Program
------------------------------------

The files you will need in your directoy are:
<ul>
<li>3dtrack2.py.</li>
<li>DataIn.py.</li>
<li>patternrec.py.</li>
</ul>

Along with the following files provided by Dr. Klay:
<ul>
<li>SpacePoint.py.</li>
<li>Voxel.py.</li>
<li>NiffteGeo.py.</li>
</ul>

With those files in your directory you simply need to run the driver-script titled '3dtrack.py'. The program is automated and will ask you questions such as whether or not you want to visualize an event as well as which event and what your ADC threshold value is. 

Additional Notes
----------------
The visualization and sorting portion of the script are hard written into the driver script while the pattern recognition and data reader are called as functions. There are several additional files in our directory. Some are incomplete attempts at portions of the program, others are just the hard written code in its own seperate file. Additionally, you may have noticed that all the files were uploaded from the branch Ivo1 and that the author simply reads Ivo Plamenac; all the files were uploaded to Ivo's computer while developing the program and driver-script in order to test minor changes and functionality in real-time. The files were uploaded from Ivo's computer, however, when they were uploaded, the current working directory was his own branch and thus had to be pulled into master.
